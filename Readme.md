# Learning backend 

- we temporarily store images/audio in our store and also on 3rd party service like cloudinary/aws, to prevent data loss in case 3rd party service is down
- we create temp folder , add .gitkeep empty file to push empty folder to github
- use [this website](https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/#Node) to generate giignore file
- install nodemon which automatically restarts server when file changes
- install it as dev dependancy so `npm i -D nodemon`
